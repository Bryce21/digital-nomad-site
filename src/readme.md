This is the code for a site to help with travel.
It started as a personal project I was using just for myself but then I figured I could make it a site as a programming project.

This is something I wrote with an hour here or there over the course of months. I would not consider this good code (no tests at all!) and not something I would put in a real production env.
But it works which is good enough for my project. If I was going to update this again at some point I think I would cannibalize a bit of this project and rewrite it.
